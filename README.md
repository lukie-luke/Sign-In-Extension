# Auto Sign In Plugin

## Abstract

This Chrome Extension is intended to help users create recurring events to automatically sign in to websites which they specify.<br>
A user will be prompted to input a time (day, hour, minute) when the extension should open a specified webpage (url input). This code may be altered so that specific web pages will trigger sign in buttons (assuming a credential autofill) or any other UI interaction.
